## Windows GUI

Run the simple chat interface on Windows using Python and Tkinter:

```powershell
cd Scripts
python windows_gui.py
```

The GUI automatically starts the backend chat server and lets you send
queries to it. Ensure that Python and required packages from
`requirements.txt` are installed.
