# DepthOverlayApp

This is a simple SwiftUI example that demonstrates how to capture an image from the camera or select one from the photo library and overlay the associated depth map (if available).

Open the `DepthOverlay` folder in Xcode and run the project on a device that supports depth capture. When you pick or capture a portrait photo, the app extracts the depth data and displays it on top of the original image with partial transparency.
